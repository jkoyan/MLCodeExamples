# MLCodeExamples
The MLCodeExamples Code Repository contains python and r code used to demonstrate machine learning examples.

1. The nbmodel directory contains code snippets to create a Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier from the scikit-learn python framework,
   the classifier is trained with a training dataset, the classifier is then used to perform classification and predict 
   class outcomes on a test dataset. The classification is performed on the iris dataset which contains 4 features viz.
     * Sepal Length
     * Sepal Width
     * Petal lentgh
     * Petal Width
     
   The class outcome can be one of the possible 3 outcomes which is setosa,versicolor and virginica. Each class refers to a type of iris plant.
   For more information on the code please refer to the readme.md in the nbmodel directory.
